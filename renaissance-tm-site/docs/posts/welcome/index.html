<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Digital humanities work promises researchers access to unthinkably large corpora spanning upwards of 278,000 books <span class="citation" data-cites="gao2020"><a href="#ref-gao2020" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> and 300 billion words <span class="citation" data-cites="goldberg2013"><a href="#ref-goldberg2013" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>. Computer scientists have effectively used these corpora to train increasingly-powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, many of the insights in these corpora remain inscrutable to human researchers.</p>
<p>Blei <span class="citation" data-cites="blei2012"><a href="#ref-blei2012" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span> and others have described some of the valuable research which can arise from corpora-level analysis centered in the humanities. Corpora-level analysis allows researchers to examine the evolution of texts over time; search for specific topics; understand the influence of authorship; provenance; and other non-contextual features on literature’s themes, and more.</p>
<p>A major tool in doing this digital humanities work is topic modeling<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, however, its difficulty represents a major stumbling block for new and experienced scholars alike. Broadly, we consider the motivations of topic modeling, adapted from <span class="citation" data-cites="batmanghelich2018"><a href="#ref-batmanghelich2018" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>, to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizing</strong> documents into thematic categories</li>
<li><strong>Designing</strong> categories with appropriate levels of granularity and abstractness</li>
<li><strong>Describing</strong> the evolution of those categories over time</li>
<li><strong>Enabling</strong> a domain expert to analyze and understand the content</li>
<li><strong>Finding</strong> relationships between categories</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong> how authorship, origin, and other contextual features influence content</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metaphors-irony-and-context">Metaphors, Irony, and Context</h2>
<p>Corpora of historical literature share much of the same problem space as more modern corpora, however, they also present unique challenges.</p>
<h2 id="our-corpus">Our Corpus</h2>
<p>To explore race and politics in Renaissance literature—as well as develop new methods in the digital humanities—we are utilizing the <a href="https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/vep/vep-tcp-collection/">Visualizing English Print</a> corpus with standardized spellings generated from texts released by the <a href="https://textcreationpartnership.org/">Text Creation Partnership</a> as part of the <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebogroup/">Early English Books Online</a> corpus.</p>
<p>It contains ____ from ___ to ___ and ___ unique words. Explore some of the collection’s metadata below.</p>
